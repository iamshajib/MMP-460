        <p>This is going to be my own portfolio, where I'll put some of my own works. Including my class works, and the works I have done from my passion. Instate of making a website for someone else I thought I better make my own to keep my works all together in cloud. That will be one of the secure ways to keep my work for future references. And most importantly as a multimedia student I am going to need a portfolio in future. It will be an easier way to show my works to others. <span class="hidden-xs">Also share it if somebody needs. That’s how my audience and me will also get benefit from it. Right now my intended audience will be my classmate and my friends. But my main intention will be to make my portfolio stronger for qualifying for a better job. <br/><br/>

        I'll include some of my website works, my graphics design, and some other class works. I'll also include some of my works which I have done from my passion such as my poems, some of my stage drama, my photography etc. I'll try to keep it simple. There are many website where you will see lots of content in one page. But I'll keep my content clear for the audience. I shall use grid to emphasis the important content. I am not goanna use lot of color in my pages. I will go with three to four colors. And those will be black, white, gray and one more. There are some website which provides many colors for the content. So these are some basic things which will be different between my website and others.</span></p>
